# Workflow-level permissions ensure that all jobs have the necessary permissions
# even if repository settings restrict default GITHUB_TOKEN permissions.
# Individual jobs can override these permissions if needed.
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  id-token: write  # Required for trusted publishing (OIDC) to crates.io

# Note: This workflow uses GitHub Secrets for token management.
# For centralized secret management with Bitwarden CLI, you can optionally
# integrate Bitwarden CLI by:
# 1. Adding Bitwarden CLI installation step
# 2. Authenticating with Bitwarden API key (stored as GitHub Secret)
# 3. Retrieving tokens from Bitwarden vault
# 4. Using retrieved tokens in release-plz steps
# See docs/BITWARDEN_SETUP.md for details on Bitwarden CLI integration.
#
# IMPORTANT: If this workflow fails with "GitHub Actions is not permitted to
# create or approve pull requests" (403 error), verify repository settings:
# - Go to Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
# - Ensure "Read and write permissions" is selected (not "Read repository
#   contents and packages permissions")
# - Or ensure "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is enabled
# - If repository settings cannot be changed, use a Personal Access Token (PAT)
#   with 'repo' scope stored as RELEASE_PLZ_TOKEN secret instead of GITHUB_TOKEN
